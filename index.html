   <h2>What is a Foodie?</h2>
    <h3>Many have tried to capture the essence of this word...</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Google's dictionary - 'a person with a particular interest in food; a gourmet'</li>
        <li>Cambridge dictionary - 'a person who loves food and is very interested in different types of food'</li>
        <li>Dictionary.com - 'a person keenly interested in food, especially in eating or cooking'</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Some have even tried to convey the Foodie Spirit through examples...</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Urban Dictionary - 'Person #1: I'm a foodie, I love eating food!
            Person #2: Wow, you're so unique. I hate food and wouldn't eat it even if I had to to stay alive.'</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Yet Foodies around the world continue to feel misunderstood, even underrepresented, forced to suppress their secret passion for the sumptuous texture of, say, chocolate mousse, due to societal pressure that pushes people to stay "lean" and "healthy" :( </h3>
    <h2>But never fear! This website shall soon fix that problem with its Foodie Guide, Quiz, Form, and even the creator's suspicions about certain 'Famous Foodies', which will spread the Spirit of Foodie around the world, ensuring that it is welcome wherever it goes!!</h2>
